# Optimal-Chess-Moves
The goal of this project is to allow a player to take a picture of the chess board and have an algorithm tell you the optimal move.


# Note:

I can't affor a decsent computer that has GPU, this is why any object detection model training will be done using Google Colab. I paid for the $9.99 pro version so that I could use their faster cloud GPU without worrying about the kernels restarting every 30 minutes. 

# Dataset:

Training set   : 400
Validation set : 100
Testing set    : 100
